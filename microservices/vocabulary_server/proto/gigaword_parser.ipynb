       " u'Member states, not UN, to blame for confusion: Boutros-Ghali',\n",
       " u\"UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a bid to deflect mounting criticism UN operations, said Friday that UN member states were to blame for any confusion in the world body's action in international crises such as ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\",\n",
       " u'\"The UN is neutral and and carries out the decisions adopted by the 15 states (on the Security Council), which include the five superpowers,\" he said in an interview on French radio.',\n",
       " u'The UN chief was in the French capital to discuss the Bosnian crisis ahead of an international ministerial conference on the matter Friday in Geneva.',\n",
       " u'Paris earlier this week threatened to pull its forces out of Bosnia -- where they form the largest UN peacekeeping contingent -- if progress towards a negotiated settlement cannot be obtained.',\n",
       " u'The French warning came ahead of the meeting Friday in Geneva by foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and five European Union states including France and Britain to try to restart the Bosnian peace process.',\n",
       " u'Boutros-Ghali said the UN could only be \"accused of subjectivity in the sense that it executes\" Security Council decisions.',\n",
       " u'But he conceded that member states might get \"tired\" about military and financial demands if UN peace operations carry on endlessly.',\n",
       " u'When asked about the French threat of a force pull-out in Bosnia, Boutros-Ghali said it was up to the Security Council -- of which France is a permanent member -- to find replacements.',\n",
       " u'He noted the example of Somalia, where after the departure of US, German, Belgian and French forces, the UN operation was handled essentially by African and Asian troops.',\n",
       " u'\"I have no way to prevent a member state from withdrawing its forces\" from a UN military operation,\" he said.',\n",
       " u'He also said he regretted huge outstanding financial commitments to the UN by member states, such as the United States which he said owes more than a billion dollars.',\n",
       " u'It was the United Nations\\' duty \"to help member states either find peaceful solutions to conflicts, or to serve as an alibi for states that need the United Nations to excuse their lack of action.\"',\n",
       " u'He stressed the United Nations had been successful in recent years in El Salvador, Cambodia and South Africa.',\n",
       " u'Even in Yugoslavia, he said, the United Nations could claim some successes, such as aid supplied for some two million refugees and displaced people, heading off the spread of trouble to Macedonia with a UN deployment and, up to now, having kept the war inside ex-Yugoslav borders.',\n",
       " u'Prisoners in their own capital by Annie Thomas',\n",
       " u'They are prisoners in their own capital, paralysed by fear and ravaged by hunger, sheltering from the gunfire in hotels and churches and the Kigali sports stadium.',\n",
       " u'Across town where troops of the government dominated by the Hutu majority hold sway, 5,000 displaced persons have found a refuge in the Holy Family church and the adjoining school. There are 550 more in the Thousand Hills hotel.',\n",
       " u'But shells hit the Holy Family compound last month, killing 15 people and leaving more than l00 wounded. There were similar attacks on the stadium and the hospital, leaving dozens of dead. Everybody else blames the warring forces, but they deny targeting the refugees. \"It was an accident, mortars are inaccurate weapons,\" they say.',\n",
       " u'Father Wenceslas Munyeshyaka shows the hole in the church roof.',\n",
       " u'Hundreds of people are lying in the nave, right up to the altar. In a big side chapel, Red Cross workers tend the wounded.',\n",
       " u'Many of the refugees in the hotel are educated people branded as \"intellectuals\", along with traders, people under threat because of their political allegiances or tribal affiliation. They said they had received word they would be massacred before the week was out.',\n",
       " u'They sent an SOS to the world community, asking it to put pressure on the authorities here to let them leave. The United Nations assembled a convoy l0 days ago to take 60 of them to the airport, but soldiers and militiamen turned them back, wounding several people in the process.',\n",
       " u'UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala-Lasso met the belligerents on Wednesday and Thursday and got promises that something would be done to let the \"hostages\" be evacuated. Some want to move to neighbouring countries, others want to go farther afield, while some simply want to change their prefectures, coded language meaning they want to go to an administrative district held by their own tribesmen.',\n",
       " u'Not all the Tutsi want to go to RPF zones, however, for fear of being forcibly conscripted to rebel ranks. A refugee at the brand new King Faisal hospital said the rebel movement executed people who slipped out without permission. \"We can no longer go looking for firewood, food or water,\" he said.',\n",
       " u'Prudence spoke in a low voice, fearful of spies overhearing her.',\n",
       " u'Her husband was an adviser to the murdered prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and she does not know if he is still alive.',\n",
       " u'The ordinary townspeople still in their own homes rush out when the shooting dies down to fill their cans with water or buy a bag of beans. But most of the fugitives have not ventured out from their shelters in more than a month, sure that only death awaits them on the streets.',\n",
       " u'Benetton picked up their second Formula One team on Friday, when manager Flavio Briatore took control of French strugglers Ligier.',\n",
       " u\"Briatore, backed by the Italian clothing giant, had been angling for months to get hold of the team's Renault V-10 engine, which has powered Williams to two consecutive driver and constructor world titles.\",\n",
       " u\"Ligier's entrepreneur owner Cyril de Rouvre, who had bought the team from Guy Ligier in late 1992, was forced to sell after becoming the subject of a fraud investigation last December.\",\n",
       " u'A statement, issued by Ligier\\'s sponsors here for the Monaco Grand Prix, said that of several offers received: \"Flavio Briatore\\'s plan seemed the best solution, one will enable Ligier to make up lost ground technologically, get back to a competitive level and thereby ensure its future.',\n",
       " u'\"Benetton-Ford\\'s results in the 1994 world championship, its technical reputation, notably in the area of aerodynamics and suspension, were a deciding factor in the choice.\"',\n",
       " u'Benetton Ford driver Michael Schumacher has won all three Grands Prix this season.',\n",
       " u'Briatore, whose Benetton-Ford team is based in Britain, is expected to outline his plans for Ligier on Saturday evening.',\n",
       " u\"The Principality authorities said on Friday that Prince Rainier had no plans yet to cancel Sunday's race.\",\n",
       " u'\"There is no question of that at the moment,\" a spokesman said, adding that such a decision would come from the Automobile Club de Monaco and race organisers.',\n",
       " u'The comment follows speculation that if Wendlinger died, the prince would have the race cancelled.',\n",
       " u\"Officials here were meanwhile awaiting the outcome of a drivers' meeting which started earlier in the morning.\"]"
