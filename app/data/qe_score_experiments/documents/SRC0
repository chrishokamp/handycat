On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the running of the nation.
Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence, Mr Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim.
Before rubbing shoulders with the US president, Mr Pena Nieto's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, the State of Mexico.
A populous, sprawling state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stomping ground.
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nieto's new motorways, a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change.
We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change, says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
Particularly in terms of security and the economy, we're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs.
After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
